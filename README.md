# Patchright Browserpool Cluster

Create a cluster of patchright workers. This library spawns a pool of browser instances via Patchright and helps to keep track of jobs and errors. This is helpful if you want to crawl multiple pages or run tests in parallel. Patchright Browserpool Cluster takes care of reusing and restarting the browser in case of errors.
